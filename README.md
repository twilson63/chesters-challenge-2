# Chesters Challenge 2

This is an easy game to demonstrate how component application architecture and the virtual dom can work.

There is a 10 x 10 grid that can randomly have grapes in each cell, and the point of the game is for the racoon chester to grab all the grapes as fast as he can.

## Step 1
